**Abstract:** <br>
Foraging in a predictable local environment requires coordinating effective movement with the observable spatial context, i.e. navigation.
Separate from search, navigation has been recently shown to be controlled by two partially dissociable, concurrently developed systems in the brain.
The cognitive map informs an organism of its location, bearing, and distances between environmental features, and critically allows the flexible use of shortcuts.
Visual response-based navigation via routes, on the other hand, is commonly viewed as subserving map-based representations and described in terms of error from optimal movement.
As such, navigation models widely assume the primacy of maps, with predictive control and distance perception as requirements, and neglect response-based perception and cognition.
Here we show the sufficiency of a minimal feedforward framework for robust navigation, an emergent bifurcation in angle-based perceptual strategy, and convergence with multiple observed biological behaviors.
Our agents, directly translating visual perception to movement, navigate to a known goal in an open field, an environment often assumed to require prediction and map-based representations.
Despite identical environmental and cognitive constraints, as well as lacking perceptual distance information, 
two distinct angle-based strategies develop, providing evidence for a perceptual-environmental attractor hypothesis for the origin of individual difference.
Furthermore, the similarity of learned movement behavior with rodents, insects, fish, and sperm cells suggest the significance of response-based navigation throughout biology.
We suggest the addition of feedforward, response-based models to the study of navigation as an alternative to predictive, map-based systems, 
both to offer an option requiring less computational energy and to better explain biological behavior.
