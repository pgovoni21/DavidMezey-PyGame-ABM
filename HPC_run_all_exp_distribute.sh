# BEHAVIOR:
# Parses the abm/data/metarunner/experiments folder and runs each experiment py file in the folder on the HPC cluster.
# Each experiment will be run on a different node.
# Prepares the environment on the gateway such es env files, empty folders for logging and errors of the jobs, etc.

# Define how many repetitions should we simulate on the cluster in a heavily distributed manner,
# meaning we run only 1 batch per instance but we create many instances that can be distributed on the
# HPC cluster creating a parallel computation pool.
# To handle all the instances the original experiment file will be copied N times with random hash strings as
# well as N env files will be created. For each a new singularity instance will be dedicated. The saved data
# will be in the abm/data/simulation_data folder with the random hashes which then can be merged into a single experiment
# folder later.
